Explicit Render Attempts (electron/main.ts:561-667)\n\nCreated typed render attempt system:\n- RenderAttempt interface: name (COPY/REENCODE/LAST_RESORT) + args\n- RenderAttemptFailure: captures attempt name, error, stderr tail\n- tryRenderStrategies(): orchestrates sequential attempts with failure collection\n\n### 2. Comprehensive Failure Collection\n\ntryRenderStrategies() behavior:\n- Try each attempt sequentially (COPY → REENCODE)\n- On NON_ZERO_EXIT: record failure, continue to next attempt\n- On TIMEOUT/CANCELLED/SPAWN_FAILED: fail immediately (no retry)\n- If all attempts fail: throw error with ALL failure details\n\n### 3. User-Actionable Error Diagnosis (electron/main.ts:588-611)\n\ndiagnoseFFmpegFailure() maps stderr patterns to guidance:\n- 'unknown encoder' → Missing codec / build issue\n- 'invalid data found' / 'moov atom' → Corrupt file\n- 'permission denied' → File permission issue\n- 'no space left' → Disk full\n- 'unsupported codec' → Unsupported input codec\n\n### 4. Structured Error Messages\n\nFinal error on complete failure includes:\n- Diagnosis from stderr pattern matching\n- List of all attempts with their specific errors\n- Original stderr for debugging\n- Exit code if available\n\nExample:\n\"All render attempts failed. Missing video codec. FFmpeg may not be built with required encoders.\nAttempts: COPY: codec not supported for copying; REENCODE: encoder libx264 not found\"\n\n### 5. Refactored Render Paths (electron/main.ts:852-940)\n\nBoth original and processed preview renders now use tryRenderStrategies:\n- Original: COPY → REENCODE\n- Processed: COPY (with filters) → REENCODE (with filters)\n- Automatic fallback without manual try/catch\n- Consistent error handling across both paths\n\n### 6. Comprehensive Test Coverage (electron/__tests__/render-strategies.test.ts)\n\n10 new tests covering:\n- COPY succeeds (fast path)\n- COPY fails, REENCODE succeeds (fallback path)\n- Both fail with comprehensive error\n- TIMEOUT/CANCELLED/SPAWN_FAILED propagate immediately\n- Failure details preserved from both attempts\n- User diagnosis messages included\n- All 64 tests passing ✓\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Met\n\n✓ If copy fails and re-encode fails, app returns structured final failure\n✓ Both failures preserved for diagnosis\n✓ No hangs or orphan jobs\n✓ Existing lifecycle/cancel/timeout behavior intact\n✓ User-actionable error messages\n✓ Deterministic behavior (no silent failures)"}
